Welcome to my Sudoku game project! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Sudoku puzzle game in C programming language. Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
